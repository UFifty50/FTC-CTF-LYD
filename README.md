# GUI-FTC-CTF-LYD

### GUI Fahrenheit To Celsius, celsius To Fahrenheit and Leap Year Detector

---

This was initially my first python project using PyQT5, but eventually I got stuck and gave up. That code can be found in the `python (doesnt work)` folder.

A couple years later I decided to try again, but this time with more experience and in java. I used JavaFX/Swing to create the GUI, and it took me around 2 hours to complete.
The code can be found in the `java` folder.

The most recent version is in the `Rust` folder. It took me about 1.5 hours to complete, using the `eframe` crate.
